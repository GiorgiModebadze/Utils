    "text": "Have you got colour in your cheeks? Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift The type that sticks around like something in your teeth? Are there some aces up your sleeve? Have you no idea that you're in deep? I dreamt about you nearly every night this week How many secrets can you keep? 'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat Until I fall asleep Spilling drinks on my settee  (Do I wanna know) If this feeling flows both ways? (Sad to see you go) Was sort of hoping that you'd stay (Baby we both know) That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day  Crawling back to you  Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? 'Cause I always do Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new Now I've thought it through  Crawling back to you  So have you got the guts? Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts Simmer down and pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you I don't know if you feel the same as I do But we could be together if you wanted to  (Do I wanna know?) If this feeling flows both ways? (Sad to see you go) Was sort of hoping that you'd stay (Baby we both know) That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day  Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)  Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few) 'Cause I always do ('cause I always do) Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for somebody new Now I've thought it through  Crawling back to you  (Do I wanna know?) If this feeling flows both ways? (Sad to see you go) Was sort of hoping that you'd stay (Baby we both know) That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day  (Do I wanna know?) Too busy being yours to fall (Sad to see you go) Ever thought of calling darling? (Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawling back to you?"

    "text": "I'm like a puppet on a string Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond  Coulda shaped heartaches Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning Years too late She’s a silver lining lone ranger riding Through an open space In my mind when she’s not right there beside me  I go crazy cause here isn’t where I wanna be And satisfaction feels like a distant memory And I can’t help myself, All I wanna hear her say is “Are you mine?”  Are you mine? Are you mine? Are you mine?  I guess what I’m trying to say is I need the deep end Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes Unfair we’re not somewhere misbehaving for days Great escape lost track of time and space She’s a silver lining climbing on my desire  And I go crazy cause here isn’t where I wanna be And satisfaction feels like a distant memory And I can’t help myself, All I wanna hear her say is “Are you mine?”  Are you mine? Are you mine? Are you mine?  And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways So in case I’m mistaken, I just wanna hear you say you got me baby Are you mine?  She’s a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space In my mind when she’s not right there beside me And I go crazy cause here isn’t where I wanna be  And satisfaction feels like a distant memory And I can’t help myself, All I wanna hear her say is “Are you mine?”  Well are you mine? Are you mine? Are you mine?"

Or is it coming back around? Isn't it hard to make up your mind? When you're losing and your fuse is fireside  There's all those places we used to go And I suspect you already know But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same But something about it's changed  I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found Has it gone for good?

Thats right, he wont let her out his sight How the shaggers perform And the daggers are drawn Who's the crooks is this.... Crime!  Thats right, he wont let her out his sight Thats right, he wont let her out his sight Thats right, he wont let her out his sight  You'll be able to post any day of the most For the sights of all time  You knew that he'd be trouble right before the very first kiss Quiet and unassuming but you knew that they were the naughtiest She pleaded with you to take it off But you resisted and fought Sorry sweetheart I'd much rather, keep on the balaclava."

Falling about You took a left off Last Laugh Lane You were just sounding it out You're not coming back again.

It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill, And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that. It's these times that it tends, The start to breaking up, to start to fall apart Oh! hold on to your heart.  Do me a favour, break my nose! Do me a favour, tell me to go away! Do me a favour, stop asking questions!  She walked away, well her shoes were untied, And the eyes were all red, You could see that we've cried, and I watched and I waited, 'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye.  Curiousity becomes a heavy load, Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold. Curiousity becomes a heavy load, Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.  And do me a favour, and ask if you need some help! She said, do me a favour and stop flattering yourself! How to tear apart the ties that bind, perhaps fuck off, might be too kind, Perhaps fuck off, might be too kind."

    "text": "Anticipation has the habit to set you up For disappointment in evening entertainment but Tonight there'll be some love Tonight there'll be a rawkus, regardless of what's gone before I want to see all of the things that we've already seen The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine And of course its fancy dress And they're all looking quite full on In bunny ears and devil horns  I want to see all of the things that we've already seen I want to see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine And put it all back in You've got to understand it you can never beat the bandit  And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox And all that it says is that you've drank a lot You should bear that in mind tonight You can pour your heart out but her reasoning will block owt you send her after nine o clock  You can pour your heart out around 3 o clock When the 2 for 1's undone the writers block"

What it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to And your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night) Oh, but you're an explosion but you're dynamite Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand Lighting the fuse might result in a bang with a bang-go  [Chorus:] I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor I don't know if you're looking for romance or... Don't know what you're looking for Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984 from 1984!  I wish you'd stop ignoring me because you're sending me to despair, Without a sound yeah you're calling me and I don't think it's very fair That your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night) Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite) Your name isn't Rio but I don't care for sand Lighting the fuse might result in a bang with a bang-go  [Chorus]  Oh, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets Are just banging tunes and DJ sets and... Dirty dance floors, and dreams of naughtiness!  Well,  [Chorus]"

I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it ...Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone  Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial They're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree When it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book  And now that you're more than a part in the play It's slightly easier to think what to say You had us all, standing on our heads Doing our best tricks  Never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you"

You don't look old enough to me\" \"I'm sorry officer is there a certain age you're supposed to be? 'cause nobody told me\"  And up rolls the riot van And these lads just wind the coppers up They ask why they don't catch proper crooks  They get their address and their names took But they couldn't care less  Thrown in the riot van  And all the coppers kicked him in And there was no way he could win Just had to take it on the chin"

She talked to me at the bar How come its already two pound fifty? We've only gone about a yard Dint ya see she were gorgeous, she was beyond belief But this lad at the side drinking a Smirnoff ice came and paid for her tropical Reef  And I'm sitting going backwards, and I didn't want to leave Its high green mate, via hillsborough please  How funny was that sketch earlier, up near that taxi rank Oh no you will have missed it, think it was when you went to the bank These two lads squaring up proper shouting, bout who was next in the queue The kind of thing that would seem so silly but not when they've both had a few  Calm down temper temper, you shouldn't get so annoyed You're acting like a silly little boy They wanted to be men and do some fighting in the street No surrender, no chance of retreat  Drunken plots hatched to jump it, ask around are ya sure? Went for it but the red light was showing And the red light indicates doors are secured"

I wonder what went wrong So that she had to roam the streets She dunt do major credit cards I doubt she does receipts It's all not quite legitimate  And what a scummy man Just give him half a chance I bet he'll rob you if he can Can see it in his eyes, Yeah, that he's got a driving ban Amongst some other offences  And I've seen him with girls of the night And he told Roxanne to put on her red light They're all infected but he'll be alright Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!  Although you're trying not to listen Overt your eyes and staring at the ground She makes a subtle proposition \"I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down\"  He must be up to something What are the chances sure it's more than likely I've got a feeling in my stomach I start to wonder what his story might be  They said it changes when the sun goes down Around here  Look here comes a Ford Mondeo Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous? And he don't even have to say 'owt She's in the stance ready to get picked up  Bet she's delighted when she sees him Pulling in and giving her the eye Because she must be fucking freezing Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky it doesn't stop in the winter, no Around here  They said it changes when the sun goes down Over the river going out of town  What a scummy man Just give him half a chance I bet he'll rob you if he can Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan I hope you're not involved at all"

Why can't they have a laugh? He's got his hand in your chest He wants to give you a duff Well secretly I think they want it all to kick off They want, arms flying everywhere and Bottles as well it's just Something to talk about A story to tell you  Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate  I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning  Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?  This town's a different town today This town's a different town to what it was last night You couldn't have done that on a Sunday  That girl's a different girl today That girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night You couldn't have done that on a Sunday  Last night what we talked about It made so much sense But now the haze has ascended It don't make no sense anymore"
